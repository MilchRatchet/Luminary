# Luminary

Luminary is a CUDA based Pathtracing renderer.

This project is for fun and to learn more about Computer Graphics. There is no end goal, I will add whatever I feel like. The following is a list of things that I may do in the future.

- Implement better distribution function for Monte Carlo method.
- Implement denoiser.
- Implement support for triangle meshes.
- Implement support for textures.
- Implement post processing routines (AA, DoF, Bloom).
- Implement filters for the `png` routine.
- Implement custom scene description file format.
- Implement some motion properties that change the scene between each frame.
- Implement refraction.
- Implement volumetric lighting.
- Implement realtime rendering mode.

The licence for this code can be found in the `LICENCE` file.
The `zlib` library is used for the compression part of the `png` routine. Details about its authors and its licence can be found in `Luminary/lib/zlib/zlib.h`.
