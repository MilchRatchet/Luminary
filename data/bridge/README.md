LUT used in the bridges method to importance sample a vertex count. This LUT is a slice of the precomputed table used in the original paper for a mean cosine of 0.95.
It was flattened and exported as a binary so I could directly load it into memory. There are 21 floats for each vertex count. There are 64 different vertex counts.
