# About

Luminary is a renderer using pathtracing. It aims at rendering high quality images while maintaining usable performance in realtime mode. Usage is supposed to be non-artist friendly, that is, the input consists of only meshes with albedo, material and illuminance textures. All other effects come parameterized.

This project is for fun and to learn more about `Computer Graphics`. Current plans can be found in the `Issues` tab.

The goal is to use as few libraries as feasible. Currently, these include `SDL2`, `zlib`, `qoi` and `OptiX`. However, only the denoiser is used from the Optix library.

Meshes and textures in the example images are taken from the Ratchet and Clank HD Trilogy and were exported using [Replanetizer](https://github.com/RatchetModding/Replanetizer).

# Usage

The scene is described through the Luminary Scene Description format (`*.lum`). The format is documented in the [Luminary File Documentations](LumFileDocs.md). It is possible to specify a `*.obj` file instead of a `*.lum` file. This will load the mesh and use the default settings. Then one can make changes to the settings and automatically generate a `*.lum` file. Alternatively, one can generate a `*.baked` file that contains all the necessary data in one file. The advantage is that loading from a `*.baked` file is fast, however, the file can be large.

You can start as:

```
Luminary [File] [Option]
```

where `File` is a relative or absolute path to a `*.obj`, `*.lum` or `*.baked` file and Option is one or more of:

```
-o, --offline
        start in offline mode, which renders one image using the specified settings

-t, --timings
        print execution times of some CPU functions

-l, --logs
        write a log file at the end of execution

-s, --samples
        set custom sample count for offline rendering (overrides value set by input file)

-w, --width
        set custom width (overrides value set by input file)

-h, --height
        set custom height (overrides value set by input file)

-p, --post-menu
        open post process menu after rendering an image in offline mode

-u, --unittest
        run a test suite, no rendering is done

-v, --version
        print build information and exit

    --qoi
        set output image format to QOI

    --png
        set output image format to PNG
```

## Realtime Mode

<p align="center">

</p>

In realtime mode, which is used by default, you can control the camera through `WASD`, `LCTRL`, `SPACE` and the mouse. The sun can be controlled with the arrow keys. A snapshot can be made by pressing `[F12]`. You can open a user interface with `[E]` in which you can change most parameters.

# Building

Requirements:
- CUDA Toolkit 11.6
- Optix 7.4 SDK
- SDL2 and SDL2_ttf
- Modern CMake
- Make or Ninja
- SSE 4.1 compatible CPU
- Supported Nvidia GPU (Recommended: Volta or later, Required: Pascal or later)

The `LuminaryFont.ttf` file is automatically copied to the build directory and needs to reside in the same folder as the Luminary executable. You may replace the font with any other font as long as it has the same name. `zlib` comes as a submodule and is compiled with Luminary, it is not required to have `zlib` installed.
>üìù `zlib` and `qoi` come as git submodules. Make sure to clone the submodules by using `git submodule update --init` after cloning Luminary.

## CMake Options
| Option                     | Description
| ------------------------------| --------------------------------------------
| -DDEBUG=ON/OFF                | Enable Debug Mode. Default: OFF
| -DNATIVE_CUDA_ARCH=ON/OFF     | Enable that the CUDA architecture is based on the installed GPU. Default: ON
| -DSHOW_KERNEL_STATS=ON/OFF    | Enable that CUDA kernel stats are printed at compilation. Default: OFF



## Linux

You need a `nvcc` compatible host compiler. Which compilers are supported can be found in the [CUDA Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#system-requirements). In general, any modern GCC, ICC or clang will work. By default, `nvcc` uses `gcc`/`g++`.

```
mkdir build
cmake -B ./build -S . -DOptiX_INSTALL_DIR="{OptiX Path}"
cd build
make
```
Note that there is a bug in a version of G++ 11. If `nvcc` happens to use that version of G++ 11 as CUDA host compiler, the build will fail. Select a different compiler in that case using for example`-DCMAKE_CUDA_HOST_COMPILER=clang`. If `cmake` fails to find some packages you will have to specify the directory. For this look at the `Windows` section.

## Windows

Additional requirements:
- MSVC
- Windows SDK
- clang-cl

Clang-cl comes for example with mingw-w64 or Visual Studio. MSVC and Windows SDK come with Visual Studio. However, if at some point it is possible to get them standalone, that would probably also suffice. Note that the paths to the CUDA Toolkit, CMake and Ninja binaries must be defined in the PATH environment variable, otherwise they will need to be defined in cmake.

Regarding MSVC and Windows SDK paths, there are two possibilities:

__Option 1__:
```
call "{VS Path}/VC/Auxiliary/Build/vcvarsall.bat" amd64
```
This sets the environment variables containing all the paths in this terminal instance.

__Option 2__: Add the paths of the binaries to the PATH environment variable, they look something like that:
```
{VS Path}/VC/Tools/MSVC/{Version}/bin/Hostx64/x64
{Windows SDK Path}/10/bin/{Version}/x64
```
Additionally, you need to pass the path to the libraries to cmake, the paths look like this:
```
{VS Path}/VC/Tools/MSVC/{Version}/lib/x64
{Windows SDK Path}/10/Lib/{Version}
```

__Regarding SDL2__: You need to download SDL2_devel and SDL2_ttf_devel for VC, these are for example available on Github.

You can build using the following commands in the main project directory:
```
mkdir build
call "{VS Path}/VC/Auxiliary/Build/vcvarsall.bat" amd64
cmake -B ./build -S . -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="{Path}/clang-cl.exe" -DSDL2_DIR="{SDL2 Path}" -DSDL2_TTF_DIR="{SDL2_TTF Path}" -DOptiX_INSTALL_DIR="{OptiX Path}"
cd build && ninja
```
or alternatively:
```
mkdir build
cmake -B ./build -S . -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="{Path}/clang-cl.exe" -DSDL2_DIR="{SDL2 Path}" -DSDL2_TTF_DIR="{SDL2_TTF Path}" -DOptiX_INSTALL_DIR="{OptiX Path}" -DWIN_LIB_DIR="{Windows SDK Path}/10/Lib/10.0.19041.0" -DMSVC_LIB_DIR="{VS Path}/VC/Tools/MSVC/{Version}/lib/x64"
cd build && ninja
```

Notes:
- It is important to use either `clang-cl.exe` or `cl.exe` as the C compiler.
- If you use the first option, run `vcvarsall.bat` only once per terminal.
- `SDL2.dll` and `SDL2_ttf.dll` are automatically copied into the build dir and always need to reside in the same directory as `Luminary.exe`.

# Licences

The licence for this code can be found in the `LICENCE` file.

The default font provided by `Luminary` is the font `Tuffy` by Ulrich Thatcher which he placed in the `Public Domain`.
